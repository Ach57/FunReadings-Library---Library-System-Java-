# Java Library System

## Description
This Java project implements a library system to demonstrate understanding of Object-Oriented Programming principles such as polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation. The project focuses on creating a robust system with proper error handling and user input validation.

## Files
- **Books.java**: Contains the class definition for books in the library.
- **Client.java**: Defines the client class for interacting with the library system.
- **DriverClass.java**: Entry point of the application containing the main method.
- **Journals.java**: Class definition for journals in the library.
- **Library.java**: Implements the main functionality of the library system.
- **Media.java**: Class representing media items in the library.

## Features
- **Polymorphism**: Utilizes polymorphism to handle different types of library items (books, journals, media) in a unified manner.
- **Inheritance**: Implements inheritance to create specialized classes for different types of library items.
- **Encapsulation**: Ensures data encapsulation by properly defining access modifiers for class members.
- **Error Handling**: Implements proper error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions gracefully.
- **User Input Validation**: Validates user input to prevent erroneous data entry.

## Usage
To run the library system, compile all Java files and execute the `DriverClass.java` file. Follow the prompts to interact with the library, borrow items, return items, and perform other library operations.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or suggestions for the library system, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
